      '<p>Receiptify is a web application that generates a receipt of your most-played songs, artists, and genres from the past month, 6 months, or all time.</p><br /><p>Examining the media we consume— in this case, music— can offer a glimpse into our lives in a given period. In many ways, receipts can also serve as a powerful tool to capture moments and stories throughout the passage of time. I wanted to combine these two things in a shareable format, so that individuals can "collect" these glimpses and share them with friends and family.</p><br /><p>Today, Receiptify has garnered lots of love and support from across the world, with an average of 2.6 million users and 9 million page views per month. Receiptify is a recipient of the CMU STUDIO for Creative Inquiry\'s Frank-Ratchye Fund for Art @ the Frontier microgrant and has been mentioned in several publications, including <a target="_blank" href="https://heavy.com/news/2020/09/receiptify-spotify/">heavy.com</a>, <a href="https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/receiptify-turns-your-top-tracks-on-spotify-into-shopping-receipts-michelle-liu">Bandwagon Asia</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.popsugar.com/tech/what-is-receiptify-48268056">Popsugar</a>, and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/06/07/spotify-pie-chart-top-genres-artists/10003057002/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>.</p>',

      "<p>For this project, we were tasked to create an assistive device for a client with a disability. Our class focuses on small electronics and interaction, so we had to find a way to use those skills to create a device that would helpful for our client, Darnisha. Over the course of six weeks, we met with Darnisha, designed prototypes, tested prototypes, and finally created the final product.</p><br /><p>In our interviews, we found that Darnisha sometimes forgets where she puts her phone down throughout the day, and also has trouble reaching over to turn off the alarm in the morning. Our solution was a wheelchair attachment that lights up when the phone is not in the holder to remind Darnisha to keep her phone with her. The device also doubles as an alarm clock that turns off via motion sensing, so that Darnisha doesn't need to press any buttons or get up to grab anything.</p>",

      "<p>Frustrating online experiences reflect poorly on government, undermining the public's faith in the capability of their elected officials and public servants to deliver services. In the digital-era, constituents expect governments to offer the same calibre of digital service seen in online banking, or travel. In response, governments are increasingly using various types of user research approaches, including user feedback data, to make services more accountable and transparent, while ensuring that online services resonate with constituents' heightened expectations of 21st government service provision.</p><br /><p>This was the open-source intern project I created during my time at the NYC Mayor's Office of the CTO. When deployed, an agency webmaster can request a feedback module by running a CURL request, and the system will respond with a code snippet for a feedback module, set to collect data to a unique endpoint. Once the module is embedded into a site, users can fill out the form to submit feedback, and it will automatically update to the webmaster's desired endoint.</p><br /><p>While my work was ultimately not released into production due to a re-org of the Mayor's Office, I learned a lot about web accessibility, internationalization, working in local government, programming best-practices, writing documentation, and working with Azure functions.</p>",
